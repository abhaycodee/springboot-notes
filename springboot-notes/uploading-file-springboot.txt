1. if the client wants to save the data (file,image , picture,textfile) or in other word if wants to upload the file then he upload(save) the file    on server.

2. to enable the file uploading on server we have to use the =  spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true in properies file.




step 1: firstly we have to create the controller to handle the file.

step2:  by using @requestparam we can take the data from the client  by providing the name of the file in its argument.
